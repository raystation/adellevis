			<h1>My contribution to a book on the City of&nbsp;Love</h1>
			<p>January 16, 2015</p>
			<p>
			A few months ago I was contacted to include a bright and colorful watercolor illustration of the Eiffel tower in a book called &ldquo;Everyone Loves Paris&rdquo; by Leslie Johnah. Leslie put together a gorgeous book of illustrations from artists around the globe. I'm so excited to be apart of this amazing group of illustrators, and I do LOVE Paris,even though I have not been there yet! I enjoyed this book so much, it has inspired me to take a trip to Paris to create my own book of illustrations. People, places, faces, food, wine, Gothic churches, fashion. Oh lala!
