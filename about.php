				It all started on a Halloween morning in NJ, 1977, I entered this world along with my twin sister Amanda.  It was a free time to grow up then, daydreaming outdoors.  Artistic exploration started early, thanks to my mother, who would roll giant sheets of paper on the floor with paints/brushes, and let us go to town. In my late teens I worked at Six Flags drawing caricatures, plenty of faces abound, and a family of fellow artists. Later I spent 10 years living in NYC , soaking the up city life, and acquired a Bachelors in Illustration at The Fashion Institute of Technology. I was lucky to live in Brooklyn where I had a wealth of music, fashion and faces to observe on the streets &amp; subways. During this time I also lived three months in Florence, Italy, a huge influence on my life and artwork. Next stop, Paris.

				Everything has lead me to where I am today, living in Farmingdale NJ (yes, it's pretty farm-y). I'm the House Artist at a strange and amazing bar in Asbury Park called Johnny Macs House of Spirits, I take on free-lance projects, feverishly paint Pet Portraits for my Etsy shop, &amp; dig up old bottles in the woods on my spare time.
