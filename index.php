					Welcome! My name is Adelle Marcero, artist, illustrator and explorer in New Jersey. I make awesome portraits &amp; sell my art on&nbsp;Etsy.
				</h1>
				<p>
					I recently spent one amazing month in Paris <img src='img/emoji/eiffel-tower.png' style='height:1em;'>  exploring and <a href='people'>painting</a>. I was immediately drawn to Paris's people and fashion, so I decided to intercept people on the street that caught my eye and politely ask them for a photo to paint from. All said yes and I'll be forever grateful to the brave people of Paris for opening this creative door for me!
